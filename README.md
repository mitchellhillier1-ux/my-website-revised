Edit files in any text editor and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Publish
- Netlify: drag-and-drop this folder at https://app.netlify.com
- GitHub Pages: upload to a repo and enable Pages in Settings.

## Enable the contact form
- Create a free form at https://formspree.io and replace `your-form-id` in `contact.html`.


## Custom Domain
Intended domain: **https://gchgroupconsulting.ca**

### If using Netlify
1. Deploy this folder to Netlify (drag-and-drop or connect a repo).
2. In your site → *Domain settings* → **Add custom domain** → enter `https://gchgroupconsulting.ca`.
3. Follow Netlify’s instructions shown there to point DNS from your domain registrar (either use Netlify DNS or add the required DNS records).
4. Once DNS propagates, enable HTTPS (Netlify will provision a certificate automatically).

### Update in code
- We already set the canonical URLs and JSON‑LD to `https://gchgroupconsulting.ca`.
- If you change the domain later, search the project for `https://gchgroupconsulting.ca` and update.
- Replace the placeholder phone number in `contact.html` and `index.html` JSON‑LD.
